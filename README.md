### Problem 1A:
Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing student scores in two subjects: GEAS and Electronics. The data is organized in a pandas DataFrame and filtered to highlight specific students based on their names.

Problems Encountered:
Initially, it was challenging to filter the DataFrame to include only the desired students (S1, S8, S30). I needed to ensure I fully understood the concept of "filtering" in this context.

Insights:
Working with a DataFrame was a new experience. It allowed me to neatly organize the scores, making data manipulation much simpler. I recognized that pandas offers powerful tools for data analysis, but I invested time learning its functionalities.

### Problem 1B:
Project Overview
In this segment, I analyzed student data that includes scores and personal information. A new DataFrame was created using pandas, which included additional columns for hometown and gender. The data was filtered to focus on female students from Mindanao with average scores of 55 or higher.

Problems Encountered:
I encountered errors when filtering the data. I learned that combining conditions correctly using parentheses is crucial, which was a bit confusing initially.
There were instances where the output did not meet my expectations. I had to revisit my filtering conditions to ensure they were set up correctly.

### Problem 2:
Project Overview
In this analysis, I evaluated student grades and visualized the average grades across three categories: track, gender, and hometown. The pandas library was used to compute averages, while the seaborn library was utilized to generate bar charts. This analysis revealed how various factors may influence student performance.

Problems Encountered:
I needed to ensure that the DataFrame df was correctly established with all necessary columns before calculating averages. This required careful checking to confirm everything was in order.
The syntax for seaborn was initially challenging. However, after some practice and experimentation, I became more comfortable with it. I found that working through examples helped solidify my understanding.



This project provided valuable insights into data analysis and visualization using pandas and seaborn. Although I faced several challenges, each one contributed to my learning and understanding of data manipulation techniques. I look forward to applying these skills in future projects!
